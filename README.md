A web application which lets employees of an organisation to add/manage challenges for internal hackathons.

To set-up this Angular application on your machine, you can either clone from my repository or download the application code in a zipped folder.

**Prerequisites**: Please ensure you have node installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from www.nodejs.org and follow the listed steps. To check if the installation was successful, you can run 'node -v' and 'npm -v' in a terminal.

**Steps to run the application on your machine**:
If you have a zip folder, unzip it at the location in your file system where you want to place the code, open the project directory in a code editor of your choice and run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in a terminal at your project's location. This will instruct the npm to install all the project related dependencies so that we can run the project without breaking it.

After 'npm i' is executed successfully, run 'ng serve' in a terminal at your project's location. You should see a successful execution of this command and the URL to access the application, normally at port 4200.

**Credentials**: When we run the application, we land on the login page on which the user is prompted for their Employee ID (1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004).
